<b>TASK</b><br />
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.<br /><br />

- Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.<br />
- Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.<br />
- Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.<br /><br />

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?<br /><br />

A. 10/63<br />
B. 2/7<br />
C. 17/42<br />
D. 31/126<br /><br />

Below are the probabilities of each case displayed:<br />
X: 4/7 (red) | 3/7 (black)<br />
Y: 5/9 (red) | 4/9 (black)<br />
Z: 4/8 (red) | 4/8 (black)<br /><br />

XY(red) = (4/7) * (5/9) = 20/63<br />
XZ(red) = (4/7) * (1/2) = 4/14<br />
YZ(red) = (5/9) * (1/2) = 5/18<br /><br />

XY(red)Z(black) = (20/63) * (1/2) = 20/126<br />
XZ(red)Y(black) = (4/14) * (4/9) = 16/126<br />
YZ(red)X(black) = (5/18) * (3/7) = 15/126<br /><br />

XY(red)Z(black) U XZ(red)Y(black) U YZ(red)X(black) = <br />
= 20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126 = 51/126 --> 17/42.<br /><br />
