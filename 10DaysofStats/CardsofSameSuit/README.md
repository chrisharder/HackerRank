<b>TASK</b><br />
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?<br /><br />

[A] 1/156<br />
[B] 12/39<br />
[C] 1/39<br />
[D] 12/51<br /><br />

The first drawn card can be anything, since the second drawn card must match the suit of whatever is drawn.<br />
Given one suited card has been removed from the deck, this leaves 12/51 probability of being drawn (or [D]).<br /><br />
