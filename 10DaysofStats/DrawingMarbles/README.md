<b>Day 3: Drawing Marbles</b><br /><br />

<b>Task</b><br />
A bag contains 3 red and 4 blue marbles.<br />
Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement.<br />
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?<br /><br />

[A] 1/12<br />
[B] 1/6<br />
[C] 7/12<br />
[D] 2/3<br /><br />

There are 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles initially. However, after the first red is drawn, the pool changes to 2 red and 4 blue.<br />
Out of 6 remaining marbles, there is a 2/3 chance (or [D]) of it being blue.<br /><br />
