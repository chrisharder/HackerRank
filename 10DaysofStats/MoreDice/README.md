<b>TASK</b><br />
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each dice will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.<br /><br />

[A] 1/9<br />
[B] 1/6<br />
[C] 2/3<br />
[D] 5/6<br /><br />

P(Event) = N(Favorable Outcomes) / N(Total Outcomes)<br /><br />

If two dice are rolled in a single toss, there are 36 possible outcomes.<br />
[ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6),<br />
(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),<br />
(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6),<br />
(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),<br />
(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6),<br />
(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]<br /><br />

Similar to the BasicProbability exercise, we can observe a total of 4 possible events with the desired outcome.<br />
4/36 = 1/9. [A]
