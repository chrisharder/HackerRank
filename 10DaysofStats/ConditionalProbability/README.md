<b>TASK</b><br />
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?<br /><br />

A. 1/3<br />
B. 1/2<br />
C. 2/3<br />
D. 1/9<br /><br />

Conditional probability relates to the probability that an event will occur based on the fact that a previous event has already occurred.<br />
Refers to the chances that some outcome (A) occurs given another event (B) occurred-- or A given B: P(A|B)<br /><br />

Below are the possible outcomes:<br />
	-	Boy, Girl<br />
	-	Boy, Boy<br />
	-	Girl, Boy<br />
	-	Girl, Girl<br /><br />

We know 1 child is a boy, reducing possible outcomes to:<br />
	-	Boy, Girl<br />
	-	Boy, Boy<br />
	-	Girl, Boy<br /><br />

Only one of these match the desired outcome, therefore there is a 1/3 probability.<br /><br />
